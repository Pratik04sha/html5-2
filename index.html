        <h3 id="oscar">Truth behind 'Envelopegate' emerges</h3>
        <p>The man in charge of the Oscars awards envelopes has been blamed for the gaffe that saw La La Land named best picture.
          PriceWaterhouseCoopers accountant Brian Cullinan was supposed to hand the best picture envelope to presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway on Sunday.
          In a statement, PwC said he "mistakenly handed [them] the back-up envelope on  <time datetime="2017-02-15T19:00">Ferbruary 26th</time>. for actress in a leading role instead."
          It's also emerged that Cullinan tweeted a picture of Emma Stone backstage just minutes before the mix-up took place.
          The tweet has since been deleted, though it survives on various websites and on a cached Google page.

        <h3 id="analysis">How does the US military need strengthening?</h3>
        <p>President Donald Trump has proposed a 10% increase in the defence budget for next year, an addition of some $54bn (Â£43bn).
          This funding request is only the start of a budgetary process, but even at the outset the Trump figures are not quite what they seem. The outgoing Obama administration was also projecting an increase in defence spending in 2018 - up by about $35bn, so actually the Trump "increase" in dollar terms is some $19bn.
          The Trump administration's numbers have already drawn criticism from leading law-makers on Capitol Hill. Senator John McCain, who chaired a bi-partisan panel on the re-building of the US military that reported in January, insists that the Trump Administration is not planning to spend enough.
          "With a world on fire,", said Mr McCain, "America cannot secure peace through strength with just 3% more than President Obama's budget...We can and must do better."
          He has argued for spending some $640bn on defence next year, in contrast to Mr Trump's $603bn, rising to a total of $800bn by 2022.

        <h3 id="trump">for town hall protests and security leaks</h3>
        <p>US President Donald Trump has said he believes Barack Obama is behind the protests against Republican lawmakers, and national security leaks.
          He told Fox News: "I think President Obama's behind it because his people are certainly behind it", but added: "I also think it's just politics".
          Mr Trump offered no evidence for his claims; his predecessor in the White House has not commented.
          Mr Trump also spoke about his budget plans and other issues.
